## A simple finite volume tool written in Julia
This code is a Matlabesque implementation of my Matlab finite volume tool. The code is not in its most beautiful form, but it works if you believe my words. Please remember that the code is written by a chemical/petroleum engineer. Petroleum engineers are known for being simple-minded folks and chemical engineers have only one rule: "any answer is better than no answer". You can expect to easily discretize a linear transient convection-diffusion PDE into the matrix of coefficients and RHS vectors. Domain shape is limited to rectangles, circles (or a section of a circle), cylinders, and soon spheres. The mesh can be uniform or nonuniform:
  - Cartesian (1D, 2D, 3D)
  - Cylindrical (1D, 2D, 3D)
  - Radial (2D r and \theta)

You can have the following boundary conditions or a combination of them on each boundary:
  - Dirichlet (constant value)
  - Neumann (constant flux)
  - Robin (a linear combination of the above)
  - Periodic (so funny when visualize)

It is relatively easy to use the code to solve a system of coupled linear PDE's and not too difficult to solve nonlinear PDE's.

## Installation
You need to have [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [mayavi](http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/) installed. 
### Linux
In Ubuntu-based systems, try
```
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib mayavi2
```
Then install `JFVM` by the following commands. The second line pulls the latest (and recommended) version of `JFVM`:
```
Pkg.add("JFVM")
Pkg.checkout("JFVM")
```

### Windows
There are a few issues with 3D visualization in windows right now. This is the workflow if you want to give it a try:
  - Download and install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads)
  - Run `anaconda command prompt` (as administrator) and install `mayavi` and `wxpython`:
    * `conda install mayavi`
    * `conda install wxpython` (Not necessary if you clone the latest version of JFVM)
  - Install [github for windows](https://windows.github.com/)
  - open `Julia` and type 
  ```
  Pkg.add("JFVM")
  Pkg.checkout("JFVM")
  ```

Please let me know if it does not work on your windows machines.

## Tutorial
I have written a short [tutorial](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/simulkade/JFVM.jl/blob/master/examples/jfvm_tutorial.ipynb), which will be extended gradually.

## In action
Copy and paste the following code to solve a transient diffusion equation:
```jl
using JFVM
Nx = 10
Lx = 1.0
m = createMesh1D(Nx, Lx)
BC = createBC(m)
BC.left.a[:]=BC.right.a[:]=0.0
BC.left.b[:]=BC.right.b[:]=1.0
BC.left.c[:]=1.0
BC.right.c[:]=0.0
c_init = 0.0 # initial value of the variable
c_old = createCellVariable(m, 0.0, BC)
D_val = 1.0 # value of the diffusion coefficient
D_cell = createCellVariable(m, D_val) # assigned to cells
# Harmonic average
D_face = harmonicMean(D_cell)
N_steps = 20 # number of time steps
dt= sqrt(Lx^2/D_val)/N_steps # time step
M_diff = diffusionTerm(D_face) # matrix of coefficient for diffusion term
(M_bc, RHS_bc)=boundaryConditionTerm(BC) # matrix of coefficient and RHS for the BC
for i =1:5
    (M_t, RHS_t)=transientTerm(c_old, dt, 1.0)
    M=M_t-M_diff+M_bc # add all the [sparse] matrices of coefficient
    RHS=RHS_bc+RHS_t # add all the RHS's together
    c_old = solveLinearPDE(m, M, RHS) # solve the PDE
    visualizeCells(c_old)
end
```

Now change the 4th line to `m=createMesh2D(Nx,2*Nx, Lx,2*Lx)` and see what happens.
